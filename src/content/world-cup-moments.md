<summary>The project</summary>

### Flexible media
>Flexible media is content that supports non-linear, personalised consumption. 

Outcomes from the work to date suggested audiences valued flexible experiences.
<br>

### Project goal
The goal for this project was to enhance coverage of the World Cup - to provide the user with a more flexible live experience on BBC Sport.
<br>

>Enhancements included:
>
>- The ability to view and navigate between key match moments
>- View match statistics from any point in the match
>- View player line-ups

## ü•Ö Discovery & understanding

<details>
<summary>Needs</summary>

### User needs
>I met with the Senior UX Designer in BBC Sport to learn more about audience needs and work in progress. 

Research outcomes revealed a need for more in-depth match statistics. Specifically for important matches like the World Cup, and when attention was divided. Participants also expressed their preferred level of complexity.

In addition, the Designers had:

- Made developments in the way scores and fixtures were communicated
- Explored a dark mode, which suited immersive environments like the media player
- Refined icons for familiarity
- Explored a 'timeline' feature

<br>

### Business requirements
Flexible media was one of 5 R&D workstreams identified as an enabler for achieving long term growth. 

The workstreams were identified as part of an OKR to increase experimentation and advance innovation across the product space.

By scaling up experimentation, this project would contribute towards the OKR and stimulate further progress across portfolios.

<summary>Constraints</summary>

### The clock
Overall, we had 2 Months before the first World Cup match. 

>For the designs, we had 2 weeks to:
>
>- Understand the landscape
>- Explore potential solutions to determine feasibility
>- Define the experience
>- Gather feedback for refinements

I decided to use the first week for exploration and to determine feasibility. And the second week for refining the experience.

<br>

### Mobile-last
>Due to time limitations, there was a desire to focus on larger screen sizes.

There were concerns that aiming for the World Cup was overly ambitious. To find a workable solution for smaller screen sizes in that time seemed impractical. 

However, a desktop-only experience seemed outdated to me. To serve users a truly flexible experience, small screens needed to be considered. 

After discussing it with the team, I considered smaller screen sizes in the exploratory designs, while prioritising larger screen sizes.
<br>

### The media player
The idea was to create a plugin for the BBC's standard media player (which was used across the estate). 

>The plugin would not be able to affect the existing UI and the enhancements would be layered on top. 

>There were also two versions of the media player. We could only support the older version. 

This meant none of the improvements that were made to the media player were available. 

There was also a desire to launch the enhancements on BBC iPlayer, which was shelved as iPlayer served users the newer version.

<summary>Familiarity</summary>

### Existing designs and similar services
>To understand what users were familiar with and how to approach the designs, I looked at:
>
>- Competitor services
>- Previous explorations at the BBC
>- How the standard media player functioned on BBC Sport
>- Brand guidelines and templates for BBC Sport and the media player

<br>

### The design process
>I collated findings in a Figma file, which I shared with the working group. 

The file outlined the design process _(ie. discovery & understanding, ideation & definition, and iterations)_ for the uninitiated. 

I made the file and all the work in progress available for anyone to view, collaborate, and feed back on.

## ‚öΩÔ∏è Ideation & definition

<details>
<summary>Key moments & chapters</summary>

### Existing work
For the key match moments and chapters, there were existing designs that were created 8 years before this project. There were also some designs created more recently by the Project Manager. 

>I mocked-up ideas that aligned closely with the these designs, but also provided alternatives.

<br>

### Minimal changes
After looking at competitor services and talking to football fans, I:

- Combined the use of iconography in the recent designs, with the visual style in the original designs 
- Added the team abbreviation to the markers
- Increased the size of the key moment markers and the height of the chapters for accessibility
- Altered the interaction for the chapters, so they became an extension of the scrub bar
<br>

![Before and after](images/world-cup-moments/key_moment_markers.png)

<br>

### Alternatives
With mobile, ease-of-use and accessibility in mind, the alternatives I suggested included a carousel and a list of key moments.
<br>

![Alternatives](images/world-cup-moments/key_moments_alternatives.png)

<br>

### Outstanding questions
Outstanding questions included:

- Which key moments should be surfaced?
- How familiar was the iconography?
- If we had to use markers, could we use logic to prevent overlap?
- What information was needed for each key moment?
- How would changing schedules and extra-time affect the chapters?
- Should we shorten the text on the chapters or truncate it if it didn't fit?

<br>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Information panels</summary>

### Existing work
The Project Manager and Head of Architecture had started designing and building options for the information panels. I took these ideas as a starter for ten.

The existing designs explored:
- A side drawer on the right
- A central overlay
- A single button to launch a selection of tabs

![Existing designs](images/world-cup-moments/existing_information_panel.png)

<br>

### Ideation
>At this point, I focused on exploring:
>- The best way to access stats and line-ups
>- How the panels would work with broadcast graphics
>- Applying BBC Sport's best practice for information design
>- Applying BBC Sport's style guide

<br>

There were several ideas to consider. I sketched or noted them in my notebook, before creating mock-ups in Figma.

To access the information panels, I considered:
- Adding buttons to the existing UI for the media player
- Exposing the tabs and removing the single launch button from the existing design
- Replacing the broadcast scorecard with an interactive version

I also explored the potential for a draggable panel - so the user had more control over which part of the match was obscured.
<br>

![Sketches](images/world-cup-moments/info_panel_sketches.png)

<br>

### Outstanding questions
- What would the panels look like without any data available?
- Could users provide explicit feedback?
- Which stats should be prioritised?
- Were line-ups useful during a live stream?

<summary>Feedback</summary>

### Defining V1
>I presented the ideas and explorations to the working group. The feedback helped to define the first design iteration.

<br>

#### Key moments & chapters
For the key moments, we discovered that a carousel or list wouldn't be possible for this launch.

Instead we would use markers to identify key moments. We discussed potential logic to prevent the markers overlapping. 

Crucially, we realised that a mobile experience was more achievable than initially thought. Particularly with stats showing significant mobile usage around midday.
<br>

#### Information panels
For the information panels, we discovered that it wouldn't be possible to add buttons to the existing media player UI. And a draggable panel, might be out of scope for this experiment.

The designs used the light mode colour palette. We decided to change this to dark mode in order to align with the media player UI. This would also create a distinction between the interactive panels and the broadcast graphics.
<br>

<summary>V1</summary>

### Prototypes
>I created a set of prototypes with the feedback and discussions in mind. 

Version 1 used markers to indicate key moments on the timeline. And a set of tabs in the top right of the media player to access the information panels.

I added micro animations to smooth out the experience. And for the prototypes, included video of a football match to demonstrate the user journey.
<br>

![Version 1 designs](images/world-cup-moments/v1_desktop.png)

<br>

>I also proposed:
>
>1. An experience for small screen sizes
>2. Ways to obtain direct feedback from users
>3. States where there's no data to show
>4. Potential error messages

<br>

#### 1. Small screen experience
To adapt the experience for mobile, I removed the text labels from the information tabs and markers. I also introduced pages to the line-ups panel and arrows to navigate between them.
<br>

![Version 1 mobile designs](images/world-cup-moments/v1_mobile.png)

<br>

#### 2. Direct feedback options
I suggested adding a way for users to provide feedback. 

Initially, we thought this could be done through a survey. But later realised that it wasn't feasible to analyse the text responses in the available time. 

I proposed the ability to provide a star rating, as this was functionality that existed in other areas of the BBC. 
<br>

![Feedback options](images/world-cup-moments/feedback_options.png)

<br>

#### 3. No data to show
During the build up to the match, there would be no data to show beyond line-ups. I mocked up options to set expectations. 
<br>

![No data options](images/world-cup-moments/v1_no_data_options.png)

<br>

#### 4. Error message
Fo potential errors, I mocked up a message with placeholder text. Later, it was decided to remove the plugin entirely in this case.
