<summary>My role</summary>

### Driving the UX
>As a UX Designer at the BBC, I drove the UX with support from the Principal.  

My role involed:

- Determining requirements
- Producing designs and prototypes
- Testing designs in 1:1 sessions
- Creating a survey to refine the experience
- Providing front-end support
- Optimising accessibility

### Core line-up
- Head of Flexible Media
- Project Manager
- 4 - 7 Engineers
- Head of Architecture
- UX Principal
- UX Designer

<br>

### One BBC
>We worked on the core experience in a small multi-disciplinary team, and collaborated regularly with colleagues across the BBC. 

For the UX, we consulted with BBC Sport, Media Services, and the Assistive Technology team. 

The larger working group came together on a weekly basis for updates and feedback.

<summary>The project</summary>

### Flexible media
>Flexible media is content that supports non-linear, personalised consumption. 

Outcomes from the work to date suggested audiences valued flexible experiences.
<br>

### Project goal
The goal for this project was to enhance coverage of the World Cup - to provide the user with a more flexible live experience on BBC Sport.
<br>

>Enhancements included:
>
>- The ability to view and navigate between key match moments
>- View match statistics from any point in the match
>- View player line-ups

## ü•Ö Discovery & understanding

<details>
<summary>Needs</summary>

### User needs
>I met with the Senior UX Designer in BBC Sport to learn more about audience needs and work in progress. 

Research outcomes revealed a need for more in-depth match statistics. Specifically for important matches like the World Cup, and when attention was divided. Participants also expressed their preferred level of complexity.

In addition, the Designers had:

- Made developments in the way scores and fixtures were communicated
- Explored a dark mode, which suited immersive environments like the media player
- Refined icons for familiarity
- Explored a 'timeline' feature

<br>

### Business requirements
Flexible media was one of 5 R&D workstreams identified as an enabler for achieving long term growth. 

The workstreams were identified as part of an OKR to increase experimentation and advance innovation across the product space.

By scaling up experimentation, this project would contribute towards the OKR and stimulate further progress across portfolios.

<summary>Constraints</summary>

### The clock
Overall, we had 2 Months before the first World Cup match. 

>For the designs, we had 2 weeks to:
>
>- Understand the landscape
>- Explore potential solutions to determine feasibility
>- Define the experience
>- Gather feedback for refinements

I decided to use the first week for exploration and to determine feasibility. And the second week for refining the experience.

<br>

### Mobile-last
>Due to time limitations, there was a desire to focus on larger screen sizes.

There were concerns that aiming for the World Cup was overly ambitious. To find a workable solution for smaller screen sizes in that time seemed impractical. 

However, a desktop-only experience seemed outdated to me. To serve users a truly flexible experience, small screens needed to be considered. 

After discussing it with the team, I chose to consider smaller screen sizes in the exploratory designs, while prioritising larger screen sizes.
<br>

### The media player
The idea was to create a plugin for the BBC's standard media player (which was used across the estate). 

>The plugin would not be able to affect the existing UI and the enhancements would be layered on top. 

>There were also two versions of the media player. We could only support the older version. 

This meant none of the improvements that were made to the media player were available. 

There was also a desire to launch the enhancements on BBC iPlayer, which became impossible as iPlayer served users the newer version.

<summary>Familiarity</summary>

### Existing designs and similar services
>To understand what users were familiar with and how to approach the designs, I looked at:
>
>- Competitor services
>- Previous explorations at the BBC
>- How the standard media player functioned on BBC Sport
>- Brand guidelines and templates for BBC Sport and the media player

<br>

### The design process
>I collated findings in a Figma file, which I shared with the working group. 

The file outlined the design process for the uninitiated _(ie. discovery & understanding, ideation & definition, and the design iterations)_. 

I made the file and all the work in progress available for anyone to view, collaborate, and feed back on.

### Questions
- What was the best way to access stats and line-ups?
- How would the panels affect broadcast graphics? (and vice versa)
- What was the best way to visualise line-ups?
- What would it look like without any data available?
- Could users provide explicit feedback?
- Which stats should be prioritised?
- Were line-ups useful during a live stream?
